## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
The following were the KPIs asked during this project:
.Employees that performed below expectation.
. How many employee are in each department?
. What is the average performance rating of each department?
. What is the gender distribution across each department?
. How many employees received training and development?

## RESULTS & FINDINGS:
I observed the following:
. Gender distribution slightly balanced(Female dominated workforce)
.The workforce is older yet years of service is short.
. Operational roles dominate the organization struture, while support departments remain smaller.
. High concentration of "Fully Meets"
. Performance ratings are overly positive.

## RECOMMENDATION:
. Regularly audit and clean Hr data to avoid inconsistencies.
. Investigate why tenure is low despite having a mature workforce.
. Recognize and reward top performers.

## LIMITATIONS:
. Incomplete and missing data
. Ambuiguity in key fields like employee status, business unit and division lack clarity.
